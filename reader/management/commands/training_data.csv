"   It’s great to be back with another collection of Teaching &amp; Learning e-zines for 2014! We have had such positive feedback from the previous posts that the e-zines will be published TWICE a week from now on. Tuesday’s e-zine&#160; will feature guest posts from our Innovative Schools/Teachers and Thursday’s post will be dedicated to all things Office 365 in the Classroom.&#160;&#160;  In today’s e-zine hear from Microsoft Innovative Educator Charlotte Beckhurst, from Hartsbrook E_Act School.

Then look no further. In light of it being the new year and with a whole many more exciting Windows 8 apps on the scene, it is about time that there was something which clearly organised them into how they can be used in the classroom, depending on what you want your children or students to be learning. I am not claiming to be inventing the wheel here, instead I have taken a great diagram that illustrates Blooms Taxonomy and adapted it for Windows 8. It is a work in progress so take a look, see what you think and send me feedback on @CharBeckhurst There’s plenty more apps to be had.   Educator Spotlight: Charlotte Beckhurst    Getting App HAPPy in the classroom #Win8 This week was a busy one what with Windows in the Classroom training as well as a trip to Havering HSIS (Hsis) with Rob Cox, from Toshiba, to promote CPD courses on Windows 8 and Office 365 in the classroom. Staff at Hartsbrook School learnt how to navigate their way around the Windows 8 platform effectively picking up some new shortcuts along the way. Sharing ideas for practise, exploring the effective use of ICT in teaching and learning,&#160; as well as having a discussion on teaching with technology versus teaching through technology, staff were then able to research the range of Windows 8 apps available and come up with innovative and creative ways to use them in the classroom. In a week’s time, the staff will be submitting their plans fully trialled and evaluated to share with everyone at Hartsbrook E-ACT Free School. In addition these plans will be available to educators locally, nationally and globally on the Partners in Learning network. I look forward to cross-promoting some of their ideas on my blog too so keep your eye out for future posts.

"Ein weiteres Highlight auf den ALM Days.  Clemens Vasters aus Windows Azure Produktgruppe in Redmond über seine Keynote Smart Products und Microsoft Services auf den ALM Days 2014 : Auf nur 4 Quadratmillimetern lassen sich heute schon 32-bit Mikrocontroller unterbringen und diese können, passendes Volumen vorausgesetzt, für weit weniger als einen Euro pro Stück eingekauft werden. Es gibt Zigbee, WiFi, und andere RF Chips für einige wenige Euro und selbst komplette GSM (UMTS/LTE) Modemmodule sind für um die 20 Euro verbaubar. Auf der Hardwareseite werden mithin die passenden Voraussetzungen geschaffen, damit Geräte und Gegenstände des täglichen Lebens in kostengünstiger Form digital aufgewertet werden können, um beispielsweise eine Steuerung oder Überwachung per Smartphone oder einfachere und sogar vorausschauende Problemdiagnose und -behebung zu ermöglichen. Clemens Vasters erläutert den schnell wachsenden Bereich der „Smart Products“ und wie die Konvergenz von operationeller Technologie und Informationstechnologie auf beiden Seiten neue Möglichkeiten eröffnet, aber auch neue Herausforderungen mit sich bringt. Dabei dreht es sich explizit um ein das ganze Spektrum von Geräten, unabhängig von Betriebssystem und Plattform, inklusive Linux und Echtzeitsystemen, und darum, welche Rolle die Microsoft Services Plattform, mit Windows Azure als Grundlage, für skalierbare und sichere Gesamtlösungen spielen kann.",Microsoft Technologies
"Blog originally posted on the Office 365 blog, December 2013,  We often hear from businesses that rely on Microsoft Office to get work done, but today we’re posting a conversation we recently had with Kara Page, a college senior majoring in biochemistry. Kara has been using Office since she was 13 years old and can’t imagine life without tools like Word, OneNote, PowerPoint and Excel helping her through college. Q: You’ve been using Office for a long time. Can you share how you’re using Office to finish your biochemistry degree? Kara: I spend a crazy amount of time in the lab and creating reports on research projects. Right now, I’m working on my thesis. One of my favourite professors shared a bunch of historical research with me, but it was all printed on paper in this massive notebook. I don’t want to lug around this huge research notebook–it weighs a ton–so I’m working on compiling everything into OneNote. That way I can access the research I need for my thesis much easier on my computer, and once I graduate, I can hand off my research digitally so someone else can pick up where I left off. I also make a ton of PowerPoint presentations and data tables in Excel. Just recently I had to write two papers and do two 30-minute presentations for one of my biochemistry classes. It was a lot of work, but after one of my presentations on a neuroscience topic I’m researching, the other people in my class told me they thought my presentation looked so good and so professional. I took all the credit for it, but really it was the templates I used in PowerPoint–I just clicked the buttons. Q: I’ve also heard you’re a real whiz with Excel. Can you share a little about how you use some advanced functioning for your reports? Kara: I was attending a prep school in Miami when I started using Excel. I had a great teacher who started teaching us 13-year-olds how to use all these functions in Excel. That completely changed my life. I rely on Excel for a lot to this day, and I can see myself using it once I start my career. Just the other weekend, I spent six hours on a lab report while everyone else spent all weekend on theirs. I created some graphs that would shift and change as I added my research, and my classmates were blown away at how easy it was. In Excel, you can make your data look really clean and change the styles. People are amazed at how fast it is and how little time it takes me to finish my reports. I also don’t keep Excel a secret–when people ask me how I did that, I show them exactly how to create tables and graphs. Those advanced functions in Excel can take a while to learn, but if you learn how to use Excel in college, you’ll be set for life.  Q: Are there other ways you’ve found Office useful in completing your degree? Kara: Office saves me regularly. I know I can work on a file and the formatting won’t get screwy, or I can have a teacher’s aide review my reports and track their changes so I can see where they made suggestions or updates. And I think that the new Student Advantage benefit will help save the day for a lot more students, too. Using Office is life changing for students–we can create better reports and better presentations if we’re given the right tools. It’s like a NASCAR driver using a race car instead of a minivan – you can do your best work when you have the right tools. Q: That’s a great analogy. What about using Microsoft Office to collaborate? Kara: I love Lync. It might sound goofy, but I love the little emoticons of the cats and dogs and sheep. I’m a teacher’s aide for a class that I teach to students in Ireland and Egypt, so I have a regular schedule of when I’m on Lync and available to talk to them and answer their questions. It feels really professional, and that way I don’t have them texting me on my personal phone or trying to talk to me outside of my office hours. I also use Skype a lot. My dad lives in Singapore and travels a lot, so it can be hard to get in touch with him. But we get to see each other a lot using Skype. My little brother, who is turning 4 years old, even knows how to use Skype. It’s so cute, and he’s already better with technology than I am! Q: What do you want to do after you graduate? Do you feel like you’re learning the skills you need for your career? Kara: I definitely think knowing how to use Office and studying hard has prepared me for the “real world.” Last summer I had an internship at a research lab for the U.S. Army and it seemed so mysterious going into it, but then I realized all they work they do there is just Excel, and I know how to use that. Everyone I worked with during that internship used Office all the time, so it was great to know my skills will transfer to the working world easily. After I graduate, I want to work for a health research organization like Genzyme where people are learning about rare diseases, or continue a family legacy in public health started by my grandfather. I want to get other people as excited about this field as I am, and I want to share my love for technology. Scientists aren’t necessarily known for producing aesthetically pleasing work, but it’s so easy to do using Office.  Check out the original blog post here, and watch Kara’s Video.

"Dieser Tipp ist ein “Anhang” an den vorherigen Tipp 24 zum Thema Copy &amp; Paste. Er ist aber zu gut um nicht alleine gelistet zu werden:&#160; Man kann in Visual Studio auf “alte” Werte in der Zwischenablage zugreifen.  Wenn man in Visual Studio beim Einfügen von Werten aus der Zwischenablage einfach mal zusätzlich die Shift-Taste drückt und dann mehrmals Ctrl+V, wird man feststellen, dass “alte” Werte aus der Zwischenablage auftauchen. Das heißt ich kann mehrere Werte über Ctrl+C oder Ctrl+X in die Zwischenablage verfrachten und diese dann nacheinander durchgehen. Immer wenn ich einen Wert einfüge, ist dieser komplett markiert, wird also, falls ich erneut Ctrl+V+Shift drücke, mit dem nächsten Wert aus der Zwischenablage ersetzt. Das ist wirklich sehr komfortabel, probiert es einfach aus. Wenn ich also in dieser Reihenfolge Abschnitte markiere und in die Zwischenlage kopiere … Ctrl+C  Ctr+C  Ctrl+C  … würde ich über Ctrl+V folgendes erhalten:  Über Ctr+V+Shift erhalte ich beim ersten mal das gleiche, beim zweiten mal folgendes:  Beim dritten mal das:   Das ganze nennt sich “Ring”, weil immer dann, wenn kein älterer Eintrag mehr in der Zwischenablage ist, wieder beim neusten angefangen wird. Tl;dr Beim Einfügen von Text aus der Zwischenablage kann man mit gehaltener Shift-Taste auf alte Werte zugreifen. Kurzer Text am Rande:  Dieser Post ist Teil einer längeren Serie, in der ich ein paar der vielleicht nicht ganz so bekannten Features von Visual Studio vorstellen werde. Ich hoffe, für Euch ist der ein oder andere Kniff dabei, den Ihr noch nicht kanntet. Und wenn ihr ihn doch schon kennt: Seid stolz auf Euch und verratet den Trick auch dem Entwickler neben Euch.",Microsoft Technologies
"In Visual Studio gibt es seit geraumer Zeit eine Art Copy &amp; Paste für Fortgeschrittene. Copy &amp; Paste funktioniert ja ganz normal mit Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V. Vielleicht kennt Ihr das Problem, dass Ihr versehentlich mal eine Zeile kopiert, in der gar nix drin steht. Ihr habt dann in Eurer Zwischenablage eine leere Zeile – na super! Gleichzeit habt Ihr vielleicht unmittelbar vorher einen wichtigen Schnipsel Code mit Ctrl+X ausgeschnitten. Wenn Ihr den dann mit einer leeren Zeile Code überbügelt habt, dann ist das natürlich doppelt ärgerlich. Aber keine Sorge, es gibt einen Weg aus der Misere: Man kann Visual Studio dazu überreden, dass es keine leeren Codezeilen mehr kopiert. &#160; Ich denke, die meisten werden diese Einstellung beibehalten, sobald sie mal getroffen ist. Wo stellt man das ein? Nun, am einfachsten gibt man in der Quicklaunch Zeile (Ctrl+Q) einfach mal “Copy” ein.   Der erste Treffer bringt einen direkt zum Einstellungmenü, wo die entsprechende Seite auch schon geöffnet ist.  Hier kann man ein Häckchen wegnehmen bei “Apply Cut or Copy commands to blank lines when there’s no selection. Das wird das unbeabsichtigte Kopieren einer leeren Zeile verhindern. Wichtig: Das funktioniert nur, wenn man wirklich nichts selektiert hat. Wenn man mehrere leere Zeilen selektiert, dann werden diese dennoch in die Zwischenablage kopiert. Umgekehrt führt dieses Verhalten natürlich dazu, dass man jetzt manchmal Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V nutzen kann, ohne, dass was passiert – dann bleibt der “alte” Wert in der Zwischenablage. Gemeinhin sollte das aber kein Problem sein. Tl;dr Über das Settings Menü kann man das Kopieren von Leerzeilen verhindern.

"Esses dias estive olhando v&aacute;rios artigos sobre SQL Server em busca de inspira&ccedil;&atilde;o. Descobri que a fun&ccedil;&atilde;o fn_dblog &eacute; uma das mais usadas para montar uma demonstra&ccedil;&atilde;o de &ldquo;internals&rdquo; do SQL Server. &Oacute;timo, pois agora &eacute; minha vez de mostrar algo sobre ela. Exemplo:   Podemos usar a fun&ccedil;&atilde;o fn_dblog para ilustrar o que acontece com um comando UPDATE ap&oacute;s passar por uma replica&ccedil;&atilde;o transacional.   select * from ::fn_dblog(null,null)   UPDATE (normal):      UPDATE (com replica&ccedil;&atilde;o):    Como m&aacute;gica, revelamos que um comando UPDATE foi substitu&iacute;do pelo par de comandos (DELETE, INSERT).  Esse foi um r&aacute;pido exemplo do porqu&ecirc; essa fun&ccedil;&atilde;o fn_dblog &eacute; t&atilde;o usada em demonstra&ccedil;&otilde;es - ela mostra muita coisa interessante e invis&iacute;veis ao olho humano. A fun&ccedil;&atilde;o db_fnlog executa a leitura sequencial do log. Ela utiliza uma l&oacute;gica praticamente id&ecirc;ntica ao LogReader (sim, aquele rob&ocirc; usado pela replica&ccedil;&atilde;o transacional e Change Data Capture), usando o mecanismo chamado de &ldquo;Log Scan&rdquo;. O seu funcionamento &eacute; bastante simples:  Primeiro se localiza o in&iacute;cio do log (que normalmente corresponde ao &uacute;ltimo checkpoint nas bases de recovery simple) Depois, os registros do log s&atilde;o carregados em mem&oacute;ria e decodificados no formato de tabela  Agora v&atilde;o as minhas dicas sobre como montar uma Demo do Transaction Log: 1. Comece &ldquo;limpando&rdquo; os logs usando o comando de CHECKPOINT A fun&ccedil;&atilde;o fn_dblog sempre procura o &uacute;ltimo checkpoint realizado. Ao &ldquo;limpar&rdquo; o log, somente tr&ecirc;s registros s&atilde;o reportados:    O comando CHECKPOINT grava o ponto de in&iacute;cio (LOP_BEGIN_CKPT), descarrega as p&aacute;ginas em disco, atualiza a p&aacute;gina de boot com o &uacute;ltimo LSN (LOP_XACT_CKPT &ndash;&gt LCX_BOOT_PAGE_CKPT) e finaliza sua transa&ccedil;&atilde;o (LOP_END_CKPT). 2. Domine o conceito do Log Sequence Number (LSN) Sempre que voc&ecirc; olhar o arquivo de log, vai se deparar com o conceito de LSN. Com a fun&ccedil;&atilde;o db_fnlog n&atilde;o &eacute; diferente, pois a primeira coluna corresponde ao &ldquo;Current LSN&rdquo;. Assim recomendo que se acostume com o formato desse identificador.  Log Sequence Number (LSN) http://blogs.msdn.com/b/fcatae/archive/2010/02/24/log-sequence-number-lsn.aspx  Resumindo: o primeiro hexadecimal corresponde ao Virtual Log File (VLF), enquanto que o segundo e o terceiro s&atilde;o o offset de deslocamento (LogBlock + Slot).  3. Conhe&ccedil;a as estruturas de aloca&ccedil;&atilde;o do SQL Server Os cursos de internals normalmente falam das p&aacute;ginas GAM, SGAM e IAM e depois citam as estruturas de Allocation Unit, Partition e HoBT. Todas essas informa&ccedil;&otilde;es est&atilde;o presentes no log.  Context PartitionId AllocUnitId (AllocUnitName) Page ID / Slot ID  A coluna AllocUnitName apresenta o nome do objeto, entretanto, essa informa&ccedil;&atilde;o n&atilde;o &eacute; armazenada no log. Na realidade, a fun&ccedil;&atilde;o determina o nome do objeto a partir do AllocUnitId. 4. Por curiosidade, procure entender o que significa o Transaction SID e SPID.  Acredito que os &ldquo;amigos do sp_who&rdquo; saibam bem o significado de SPID. Em rela&ccedil;&atilde;o ao Transaction SID, procure pela fun&ccedil;&atilde;o SUSER_SNAME. Voc&ecirc; pode se surpreender!   5. Essa fun&ccedil;&atilde;o &eacute; n&atilde;o documentada. Portanto, evite rodar em uma base de produ&ccedil;&atilde;o.  Uma alternativa &eacute; usar o XEvent.

"Case Study submitted by Scott Carrington, Head of Technology Faculty, Redden Court School Redden Court School is a forward thinking and progressive secondary school. We seek to achieve the very best for all our students through the use of advanced technology and a rich variety of educational approaches. As a Specialist Academy for Mathematics and Computing, we continue to use our strengths in these areas to enhance the learning opportunities for all students and raise standards across the curriculum. As an innovative school, we are venturing into the use of tablets, wireless technology and cloud computing to enhance teaching and learning within school and provide further opportunities for students to extend their knowledge outside of school. Our journey has started with the use of Microsoft Surface RT tablets but we plan to progress further by offering 1:1 and BYOD services in the near future. Please read our initial findings in the case study below.  Students are embracing the Surface RTs at Redden Court School. Below are some photos of a Key Stage 4 class working on their GCSE controlled assessment:  Some are starting to make use of some of the Surface’s features, such as the kick stand, on screen keyboard, USB drive and the split screen, which is particularly useful when working on the spreadsheet task. Teachers are also becoming more familiar with the tablets and starting to use them as a visualizer for sharing good work on the screen and as a camera, which some of the more confident students particularly enjoy!  The use of tablets is certainly promoting collaborative learning, particularly through the touch screen functionality. The size and portability of the Surface tablets also allows for a more personal learning environment where students feel confident to share their work with each other and combine their strengths to complete tasks.  With most classes we have tried to give them 1 lesson a week on the tablets and 1 lesson on the PCs. This is to ensure that they develop the skills to adapt to a range of tools and it allows them to experience the benefits of both scenarios. It took a while for students (and staff) to get used to not being able to access the school’s network drive and their documents locally when on the tablets. However, they are gradually becoming more experience in saving work to their memory sticks or SkyDrive accounts through LGFL and Office 365. This is providing the students with a first-hand experience of cloud computing, which is a theory topic for the GCSE ICT. Office365 is also allowing teachers to set more challenging tasks for home learning as all students now have access to the Office suite at home.  Another benefit of Office 365 through LGFL SkyDrive is the ability for students and staff to share and follow documents which provides opportunities for full collaboration, such as adding, editing and commenting on each other’s work in the same document in real time. This is perfect for group work and class forums. At Redden Court we firmly believe that as tablets continue to become more multi-functional, they will replace the need to spend/waste money on a range of equipment such as cameras, video recorders, microphones, smart boards, etc. One of our favourite unique features of the Microsoft Surface tablets is the panoramic photo stitching facility. Not only do they provide a wider view of whole class learning but they also have a range of benefits. One of these benefits is highlighting key points of health and safety, which is a great starter for new students to the school. Another is from business perspective as we are able to upload interactive panoramic photos/videos of our specialist suites and rooms that can be hired during out of school hours.(see images below)  There are other features of the tablet that we have only scratched the ‘Surface’ with so far but we plan to embed them more into our lessons on a regular basis. This includes researching and experimenting with the app store and using the vast range of apps available.  Students are enjoying using the tablets and on the whole they have been a success. We certainly see the potential in the project and once we get through some of the technical issues, we will be able to fully embrace the use of tablets to enhance teaching and learning throughout the school.

"Case Study submitted by Scott Carrington, Head of Technology Faculty, Redden Court School Redden Court School is a forward thinking and progressive secondary school. We seek to achieve the very best for all our students through the use of advanced technology and a rich variety of educational approaches. As a Specialist Academy for Mathematics and Computing, we continue to use our strengths in these areas to enhance the learning opportunities for all students and raise standards across the curriculum. As an innovative school, we are venturing into the use of tablets, wireless technology and cloud computing to enhance teaching and learning within school and provide further opportunities for students to extend their knowledge outside of school. Our journey has started with the use of Microsoft Surface RT tablets but we plan to progress further by offering 1:1 and BYOD services in the near future. Please read our initial findings in the case study below.  Students are embracing the Surface RTs at Redden Court School. Below are some photos of a Key Stage 4 class working on their GCSE controlled assessment:  Some are starting to make use of some of the Surface’s features, such as the kick stand, on screen keyboard, USB drive and the split screen, which is particularly useful when working on the spreadsheet task. Teachers are also becoming more familiar with the tablets and starting to use them as a visualizer for sharing good work on the screen and as a camera, which some of the more confident students particularly enjoy!  The use of tablets is certainly promoting collaborative learning, particularly through the touch screen functionality. The size and portability of the Surface tablets also allows for a more personal learning environment where students feel confident to share their work with each other and combine their strengths to complete tasks.  With most classes we have tried to give them 1 lesson a week on the tablets and 1 lesson on the PCs. This is to ensure that they develop the skills to adapt to a range of tools and it allows them to experience the benefits of both scenarios. It took a while for students (and staff) to get used to not being able to access the school’s network drive and their documents locally when on the tablets. However, they are gradually becoming more experience in saving work to their memory sticks or SkyDrive accounts through LGFL and Office 365. This is providing the students with a first-hand experience of cloud computing, which is a theory topic for the GCSE ICT. Office365 is also allowing teachers to set more challenging tasks for home learning as all students now have access to the Office suite at home.  Another benefit of Office 365 through LGFL SkyDrive is the ability for students and staff to share and follow documents which provides opportunities for full collaboration, such as adding, editing and commenting on each other’s work in the same document in real time. This is perfect for group work and class forums.

"  David Renton is one of the UK’s Microsoft Innovative Educator Experts. In this post he describes his incredible journey with Microsoft and clearly shows why he deserves this title. He starts with sharing Project Spark… enjoy. Project Spark Demo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQbO5n71vNc  Skills Show Birmingham NEC 14th to 15th November 2013 I spent two days at the Skills Show at Birmingham NEC, at the invitation of Lee Stott (Microsoft Technical Evangelist), presenting on Microsoft’s amazing new game creation tool Project Spark and on Microsoft’s cross-platform app development tool TouchDevelop. Microsoft sponsored the City and Guilds stand at the Skills Show, which was an amazing event which had at least 75,000 visitors over the 3 days of the conference.  I also got to meet up with another one of Microsoft’s Innovative Expert Educators, Simon Johnson Highfields School - Secondary Comprehensive (11-18) in the City of Wolverhampton.a High School Computing teacher from Highfields School in Wolverhampton. I had been corresponding on Twitter with Simon for months about TouchDevelop, as he was using some of my TouchDevelop game creation tutorials with his pupils. Simon has set up a TouchDevelop challenge website with some great resources on it and fascinating examples of games created by his pupils.   Simon concentrated on TouchDevelop at the Skills Show, while Simon Michael (Microsoft Technical Evangelist) and I concentrated on spreading the word about Project Spark to the legions of High School pupils passing by. The reception for Project Spark was incredible; I really think the creative types who love Minecraft will love it. Project Spark has the creative aspects of games like Minecraft and game engines like UDK, but unlike Minecraft you can change the way the world works and program the characters to do what you want, including programming NPC (non-playable characters) with AI. Spark was created by the same minds behind Kodu and it builds on the simplistic language of KODU, so those who are familiar with coding in Kodu will take right to it, however there is so much more you can do in Spark than you could in Kodu. In Project Spark you can create a rich beautiful 3D world with its amazing next generation graphics, far superior in my opinion to the blocky world of Minecraft, but for those who love their Minecraft blocks there is even a cubify option. Project Spark has been added to the Kodu Kup competition this year and it will be launching free soon on Windows8.1, Xbox One and Xbox 360.  I had a great 2 days at the show, showing off Project Spark to the multitudes and even saw a few famous faces, like Theo Paphitis of Dragons Den fame and Princess Anne, who came by our stand for a visit, but unfortunately did not try her hand at Project Spark. I also got to demonstrate and do a recording of my Kinect Math Mage game, being played by Dolly bow bow. What you have never heard of her? Neither had I, she is YouTube famous evidently J.   Microsoft MVP Global Summit Bellevue / Redmond 17th to 21st November 2013  Straight after my 2 day stint at the Skills Show, I jumped on a plane to Seattle from London for my first visit to Microsoft HQ in Bellevue, which is just outside of Seattle on the North West coast of the USA. I was visiting for the Global MVP summit, as I have recently been awarded the title of Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for Kinect, making me the only Kinect MVP in the UK. The MVP programme has around 4000 professionals in it from over 90 countries and they answer more than 10 million questions a year to the technical community.  I got to Seattle on Saturday and the conference was beginning Sunday evening, so I spent Sunday during the day doing a bit of sightseeing, my favourite thing was having brunch at the top of the Space Needle. I spent the first 2 days learning about the new Kinect for Windows version 2 which will be coming out probably around summer 2014. It is based on the Xbox One Kinect and has many new features over the old Kinect for Windows, such as: 1. Full HD colour camera feed. 2. Much wider field of view (removing the need for the tilt motor). 3. 6 skeletons can be tracked at once instead of 2. 4. Much improved depth camera. 5. Much more accurate skeletal tracking with more joints detected and far less jitter. It can now track when someone is standing side on to Kinect. It can also detect if you are leaning forward or backwards and continue to track joints. 6. Hand detection and tracking, allowing for better grip detection and new gestures such as lasso which is pointing two fingers together for drawing or dragging. Also thumb tracking allowing the detection of a shooting gesture, which I’m sure, will have applications in games.  7. Facial expressions are now available such as left or right eye open or shut, smiling, mouth open or closed and more. It should even be able to tell if you are wearing glasses or not. 8. Most of the processing is now done on the GPU rather than the CPU of your computer. 9. It now comes with and requires a USB3 port, which allows for a much higher throughput of data from the sensor. While I was at the conference all Kinect MVPs in attendance (about 12 of us) were gifted an alpha version of the new Kinect for Windows (K4W) v2 developers kit. It really is an amazing piece of kit and the accuracy of skeletal tracking is far superior to the previous generation.  All MVPs attending the summit also received $300 off a Surface 2, making it a bargain at only $150, plus they gave us a free keyboard cover as well. I really love my Surface 2 and my iPad mini has almost been retired. There are still some Apps missing that I would love on Surface, but when I want to do some serious work on the go, or I want to take my work with me without having to carry about my full size laptop, there is no comparison and Surface wins. Plus it has a USB3 port, which might seem like a minor thing, but it really is a God send on a tablet when you have been used to not having one on the iPad.  On the afternoon of day 2 of the conference I was able to visit with the TouchDevelop team in their offices and meet Peli and Nikolai who I have been emailing for the past year. I have spoken with Peli on the phone and in person many times while I was creating my games development curriculum for TouchDevelop, which I have been using to teach games programming to our entry level college students. It was great to see where TouchDevelop was created and meet with the rest of the TouchDevelop team. On the morning of day 3 I got a message from Peli early in the morning, asking if I wanted to go to a School with him, so I quickly got ready and took a taxi out to the school for 8.30am. Peli goes to the School 3 or 4 times a week from 8am until around 9.30am and then goes into Microsoft to do a full day’s work, that’s commitment for you. I gave a talk to the class about games development and TouchDevelop and showed them some techniques I use with TD to make games with my students back in Scotland. It was fascinating to see a full class working on TouchDevelop just using phones or tablets to program on. In college we mainly run it on a pc and load it up on a phone or tablet for testing, but these students were doing it all on the phone. It was also strange and flattering to hear that students from half-way around the world were making games using my games curriculum. Later that day I recorded a video for Microsoft where I was interviewed about my use of Kinect and they also recorded me demonstrating my Kinect Games. That evening I had a great night out at the MVP attendee party at the Seattle Aquarium and Seattle Great Wheel, at which I beat Ben Lower at Kinect Golf and enjoyed a ride on the Seattle Great Wheel, which is a slightly smaller version of the London Eye. On the last day of the summit I visited Microsoft’s amazing Envisioning Center with the rest of the Kinect MVPs and I got a glimpse into the future of technology, which evidently involves a lot of talking to appliances and rooms which sense your presence and sets the environment to suit you. I also got to go to the games studio that is behind Project Spark and meet with Scott Fintel who is project lead on both Kodu and Project Spark. I got to see the team hard at work on Spark and see the amazing concept art behind Spark. Peli &amp; Nikolai from the TouchDevelop team came over later on and we jointly recorded a video with Scott, about Kodu and Project Spark for the Hour of Code on Channel9. The MVP summit was truly an amazing experience and I got to meet some incredible people from Microsoft as well as some inspirational MVPs who are doing amazing things with Kinect and other technologies. I just hope they renew my MVP award next year so I can attend again.
