"Azure VMs continue to be billed if they're shutdown from within the virtual machine. In Azure management portal, if the VM status is "Stopped", you are still being billed. Only status "Stopped (Deallocated)" means that VM is no longer incurring charges. This is also indicated in http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/&nbsp;. &nbsp;Also, it's good to keep at least one VM of each cloud service that's not in "Stopped (Deallocated)" state. This is to prevent changes to the IP which require manual and additional steps for reconfiguration. This is because the Cloud Service Virtual IP (VIP) stays with the cloud service it is assigned to, until all the virtual machines in that cloud service are all Stop (Deallocated) or deleted. At that point, it is released. This is indicated in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dn133803.aspx&nbsp;.&nbsp; This blog post is an attempt to demo such a shutdown so as to reduce billing while also trying to avoid the VIP from getting de-allocated, so as minimize downtime and minimize manual intervention during VM startup. &nbsp; So let's start and save $$!! &nbsp; Assume my setup has a domain controller and cluster nodes. All are in the same cloud service (same DNS Name). DC (Domain Controller) - ContosoDC Cluster nodes - ContosoSQL1 (primary replica for Availability Group with listener), ContosoSQL2, ContosoWSFCNode. &nbsp;  &nbsp;We'll shutdown all the servers from portal, except the domain controller. The order of shutdown does not matter though typically the primary is shutdown last, so as to prevent an unrequired Availability Group failover. In Azure portal, the status for the VMs should say Stopped Deallocated. An equivalent command in Powershell is Stop-AzureVM (without -StayProvisioned). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To minimize resource/billing further, can remote desktop to the remaining node (Domain Controller) and Shutdown from within VM. It's important not to shut down this last VM from Azure portal, since otherwise the VIP will be deallocated as indicated earlier. This is an optional step, considering the DC may anyways consume minimal resources since there are no VMs connected to it (because they've been shut down through earlier steps). In Azure portal, the status should say Stopped. An equivalent command in Powershell is Stop-AzureVM -StayProvisioned .  &nbsp;Assume off hours have ended and it's time to start the VMs. All VMs can be started from Azure portal.  For each machine that was shut down from portal (three VMs in this case), connect to each of these VMs using a local administrator account. It's important not to use a domain user account, since the shutdown process from Azure portal has changed the DNS mapping for each of these servers, so the VM may not be able to authenticate domain credentials. In my case, "vijayrod" is my local administrator account. For each of these VMs, go to Network Connections. Change properties of Internet Protocol Version 4 from "Obtain DNS server address automatically" to "Use the following DNS server addresses" and specify the IP of the DNS server (in my case DC and DNS are same server). Click OK to apply changes. This had got changed earlier during VM shutdown from portal. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On primary replica, open Failover Cluster Manager with "Run as different user" and enter domain credentials. Then start Availability Group resources from Failover Cluster Manager. Alternatively reboot primary replica and remote desktop to VM with domain user account.  &nbsp;Verify connectivity to listener from on premise SSMS. &nbsp;&nbsp;Additional note: &nbsp;The below should be avoided where possible since it requires manual steps that can increase downtime. The benefits may also be marginal since the last VM (domain controller in this example) is already shut down through a remote desktop connection. If a business requirement requires all VMs to be shut down from Azure portal (Stopped Deallocated), then the same steps like above can be followed. In addition, &nbsp;  The DNS IP points to itself so should be 127.0.0.1. Also, the listener IP still points to the earlier cloud IP. During de-allocation (since all VMs have been shutdown through Azure portal), this IP gets automatically released from cloud service. During first VM startup, a new IP may be given the cloud service. This new IP needs to be updated for the listener IP in Failover&nbsp;Cluster Manager using Get-ClusterResource (the same command used to configure the earlier IP during setup of listener). After this configuration, bring AG resource online through Failover Cluster Manager. Go to SQL Management Studio and to the listener properties. Enter the port number. The port number would have got removed earlier during configuration of new IP. Now should be able to connect using on premise SSMS.   &nbsp;Vijay Rodrigues. &nbsp;SME - SQL AlwaysOn Availability Groups.",Java
"One of the really hot topics cross our customers is the enterprise social and how to build real social intranets in global scale. In Microsoft platform this is commonly done using by a combination of SharePoint and Yammer. Currently natively Yammer however seems pretty disconnected from the SharePoint capabilities, which make the end user experience not so optimal, but we can already today further enhance the native capabilities for enabling real integration between these systems. This can be achieved by using the great Yammer API capabilities to integrate to the social platform from external systems and we can certainly use this same capability to combine or inject the Yammer capabilities directly to the Intranet portals or collaboration sites. There was numerous session in SharePoint Conference 2014 on the Yammer social capabilities, but personally I really couldn’t find proper “getting started” guidance from conceptual and practical perspective. I love great demos, but to be able to really understand the capabilities we need to also provide the simples possible samples for helping to get started on the development efforts. Simplicity is the key for understanding and then we can move to more complex scenarios. In general we have great guidance on the MSDN for SharePoint and Yammer has its own developer documentation, but&#160; since I couldn’t really find suitable information at least for me (“Getting started for dummies” level), I wanted to help hopefully on others within their journey on building social Intranet’s with SharePoint and Yammer. Following chapters are explaining the integration possibilities and how they can be technically achieved. Social Intranet with SharePoint and Yammer concept Before actually going on to the technical details, let’s first clarify the concept slightly with few pictures and some description. SharePoint 2013 had actually natively some great social capabilities, but roughly on the same time as we released the beta 2 for SharePoint 2013, we announced that we have bought the Yammer. At the time I personally didn’t really get the reason (I’m a simple person), but after working with the Yammer for a while, I seriously felt in love with it… it does provide some great social capabilities and it will dramatically to decrease the email inbox growth, which is great news for me and for many others. Classic challenge however with the Yammer has been that it feels so disconnected from the collaboration platform, which is commonly SharePoint and there is still some overlapping capabilities even in Office365 SharePoint platform. Obviously this disconnected used experience will be adjusted in the future (you don't need to be oracle to realize that), but already today you can build the needed integrations for the end users with pretty simple customizations.  Following pictures shows an imaginary Intranet concept build on top of the Office Garage (check the series) branding. I’ve just used the Office Garage colors and branding to demonstrate the capabilities and to provide some nice UI elements, but obviously this same concepts is possible to apply with any Intranet in Office365 or in the on-premises. Objective is pretty simple – let’s make the end user experience better by introducing some simple JavaScript integrations between SharePoint and Yammer capabilities so that we can combine the best from both systems..   And here’s an example of using Yammer with the team sites on replacing the out of the box SharePoint team site newsfeed discussion.   Yammer also in on-premises as the social platform? Actual initial reason why I got involved on this Yammer integration discussion was requirements from one global on-premises deployment, where the customer was not willing to go to the Office365 due miscellaneous reasons. Customer had three existing SharePoint farms cross the world and as part of the SharePoint 2013 upgrade, they wanted to start using also the different social capabilities from our platform. Default on-premises social capabilities (SharePoint social) are having some challenges with multi-farm deployments, since user profile and distributed cache information are not shared cross the farms. In this particular case customer was however also interested on seeing the possibilities with Yammer, so we designed the architecture to use Yammer as the social platform, so that we can address the needed social capabilities (messaging, discussions, likes, follows). As a side a note, we also did design a custom user profile property sync between the three farms to ensure that farm specific user profile properties are sync'd between the other farms for people search purposes. This was needed for few other planned functionalities as well and since we don’t have user profile replication engine for SharePoint 2013, this had to be solved with a custom add-on. Details on this custom sync would however require separate blog post, so let’s not go too detailed on overall architecture design and requirements. In high level the design was as in following picture. Key point was that we would use the Yammer social capabilities from the cloud as the engine for any social functionalities, but still keep the normal collaboration and document management functionalities in on-premises.  In many cases using Yammer, but then not using Office365, could be seen as strange, but in this case customer explicitly wanted to have the actual document storage in their on-premises, even though the social capabilities are coming from the cloud. Not necessarily typical setup, but completely valid hybrid design which could be taken based on circumstances.  Yammer Embed option Let’s move to actually on how to make the needed Yammer integration to happen. Yammer embed option is definitely the most easiest option to get started, since you really don’t need to do anything else than place the right JavaScript function to your SharePoint site and even authentication is taken care of for you automatically. If user has not been yet logged to yammer, he/she will be asked to do so. Key tool for creating or seeing different embed options is the following widget which can be used for solving the right feed or settings what you want to use - https://www.yammer.com/widget/configure.  So – from this widget you’ll be able to get the right embedding code for your JavaScript. In the context of the SharePoint, you can then simply use Script Web part or script embedding capability to show the needed feed in SharePoint. Simply go and add Script Editor Web Part to the page and place the below script to it.     1: &quot;embedded-feed&quot; style=&quot;height:400px;width:500px;&quot;&gt     2:      3: yam.connect.embedFeed({     4: container: '#embedded-feed'     5: , network: 'veskuonline.com'     6: , feedType: ''     7: , feedId: ''     8: , config: {     9: use_sso: true     10: , header: true     11: , footer: true     12: , showOpenGraphPreview: false     13: }     14: });     15:     This will result you the current users latest messages. You can adjust some of the settings on how things are presented, like do we show the header or footer. Check the details on the options from here https://developer.yammer.com/connect.    What’s really cool with the Yammer Embedding is also the support for using dynamically created OpenGraph objects, What this means is that we are able to create dynamically objects which can be then used as “end points” in Yammer side for discussions and other actions. This can be easily achieved by using simply the right configuration for the embedding JavaScript and the object is created dynamically for you. This is excellent capability for creating dynamic discussions or other actions towards any element you can think of… url, file, audio, video… as long as it has unique URL, you can do that. Only difference for initial OpenGraph setup is simply the details on the embedding script. Here’s an example.       1: &quot;text/javascript&quot;     2: src=&quot;https://assets.yammer.com/assets/platform_embed.js&quot;&gt     3:&#160;      4: &quot;embedded-feed&quot; style=&quot;height:400px;width:500px;&quot;&gt     5:      6: yam.connect.embedFeed({     7: container: '#embedded-feed'     8: , network: 'veskuonline.com'     9: , feedType: 'open-graph'     10: , feedId: ''     11: , config: {     12: use_sso: true     13: , header: false     14: , footer: false     15: , showOpenGraphPreview: false     16: , promptText: 'Another Page'     17: }     18: , objectProperties: {     19: url: 'https://vesaj.sharepoint.com/teams/wcm/another-page'     20: , type: 'page'     21: }     22: });     23:     And this is how it looks in the page. Notice that you can create this “virtual” OpenGraph object to any item you want. This provides excellent capabilities to integrate basic social capabilities to any system or artefact you might have in SharePoint or in any other system.    This is how OpenGraph object it looks then in the Yammer side… which you most likely won’t be really accessing that often, since you will access the feed and other actions directly from the embedded application side, which in this case is SharePoint. Notice that you can also do following and likes for OpenGraph object, which is great.    But I don’t want to manually add the needed scripts to the web part, since that’s too much work for end users… can we automate this? – Yes… certainly. It’s all about how we include the JavaScript and the elements on the page. You can include the needed JS embedding for example in the master page and then just place the needed code for page level OpenGraph element creation to the page layout. This would easily give you opportunity to have discussion board dynamically for each news article or each page in the in the Intranet.   Second alternative is to place the script editor web part to the pages automatically during the site provisioning. This capability is demonstrated in the Office AMS examples where we use remote provisioning to create SharePoint sites with right branding and with by default having Yammer group discussion for the team site, rather than out of the box SharePoint site feed.  There’s also Yammer app in the Office store to help on using the embedding mechanism called Yammer App for SharePoint, which encapsulates the basic embedding capabilities for you. If you do however want to provide some special things with the embedding, you can certainly write your own SharePoint app for this one as well. In the downloadable code package related on this code, you can find also one app part, which is simply using the my messages embedding option. This is how the embed app part looks if you’re not logged into Yammer using single sign on, cookie or particular browser session.    Following picture demonstrates how the same page looks when user is logged to Yammer.    You can easily modify this example to use also OpenGraph objects with dynamic URL resolving and whatever is needed for your deployment.  Yammer REST API pattern  Where do I need the REST pattern? – When you need some capabilities which are not available with embed option. We don’t really have that simplified examples out there and only good getting started sample was following blog post, which helped me to the right direction: http://arcsnap.blogspot.fi/search/label/Yammer%20Javascript%20API%20Tutorial%20Post%20Message. I’ve used that sample as my starting point and slightly extended it in the provided examples.  Start by registering an app to the your Yammer network. You can do this on the https://www.yammer.com/client_applications to the yammer network which you’ve registered. Easiest way to get sample Yammer network is to spin up a new Office365 test site, change the domain for it to be something else than onmicrosoft.com and after that you can register that domain as a new Yammer network for testing purposes.  Like mentioned in getting started guidance in yammer developer guidance, you’ll need to ensure that following information is available, since these are required to ensure that app works properly:    Application Name: The app name which will appear in Yammer’s activity stream.   Organization: The name of the organization affiliated with your app.   Website: Your organization’s website.   Support e-mail: An email address which users of your app can contact for support.   Expected Redirect/Redirect URI: Where Yammer will redirect to after the authentication flow is complete.   From here we get the actual app ID which is then registered for that particular network. If you really build global Yammer application, your app ID is then published cross the other networks as part of the app publishing process.     Now we have the needed client ID to access the Yammer on behalf of the user. We’ll need to use that when we operate against the Yammer. I’ve included to this blog post three different examples, which each do one reference operation (post message, read messages, get notifications), but let’s open up them slightly. What we need to have is first reference to the right yammer JS and we can perform the initial configuration in the head of the page.       1:      2: &quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt     3: Yammer My Messages!     4: &quot;https://assets.yammer.com/platform/yam.js&quot;&gt     5:      6: // initializing script     7: yam.config({ appId: &quot;k1oDkFd4HB7fUtmIk3N3lA&quot; });     8:      9:     After this it’s just using the JS APIs using the right pattern… in this case we confirming that the app and user is authenticated to the Yammer and move then forward to the actual function.       1: function post() {     2: yam.getLoginStatus(function (response) {     3: if (response.authResponse) {     4: get_my_messages();     5: } else {     6: yam.login(function (response) {     7: if (!response.authResponse) {     8: get_my_messages();     9: }     10: });     11: }     12: });     13: };    Actual request to get the latest messages for particular user is pretty simple JavaScript post. In the case of getting access, we just render the JSON object out to table format in the example scenarios.       1: function get_my_messages() {     2: yam.request(     3: {     4: url: &quot;https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages.json&quot;     5: , method: &quot;GET&quot;     6: , success: function (msg) { RenderResults(msg); }     7: , error: function (msg) { alert(&quot;No Go&quot;); }     8: }     9: );     10: };    Here’s the full html page for this particular example, just to show the full html structure. Notice that in this example I’m just outputting the JSON object to html table, but in real life, we would be then formatting this as needed for showing the right information for end users.       1:      2:&#160;      3: &quot;en&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt     4:      5: &quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt     6: Yammer My Messages!     7: &quot;https://assets.yammer.com/platform/yam.js&quot;&gt     8:      9: // initializing script     10: yam.config({ appId: &quot;k1oDkFd4HB7fUtmIk3N3lA&quot; });     11:      12:      13:      14: 'post()'&gtGet my messages!     15:      16: &quot;results&quot;&gt     17:      18: function post() {     19: yam.getLoginStatus(function (response) {     20: if (response.authResponse) {     21: get_my_messages();     22: } else {     23: yam.login(function (response) {     24: if (!response.authResponse) {     25: get_my_messages();     26: }     27: });     28: }     29: });     30: };     31:&#160;      32: function get_my_messages() {     33: yam.request(     34: {     35: url: &quot;https://www.yammer.com/api/v1/messages.json&quot;     36: , method: &quot;GET&quot;     37: , success: function (msg) { RenderResults(msg); }     38: , error: function (msg) { alert(&quot;No Go&quot;); }     39: }     40: );     41: };     42:&#160;      43: // This is just for result output - notice that to keep things simple     44: // we don't use any fancy JS libaries... you can and most likely will      45: // be using them in production, but that's another story already...     46: function RenderResults(msg) {     47: var htmlOutput = CreateTableView(msg.messages);     48: document.getElementById(&quot;results&quot;).innerHTML =     49: 'We got' + msg.messages.length + ' items' + htmlOutput;     50: }     51:&#160;      52: function CreateTableView(objArray) {     53:&#160;      54: // If the returned data is an object do nothing, else try to parse     55: var array = typeof objArray != 'object' ?     56: JSON.parse(objArray) : objArray;     57:&#160;      58: var str = '';     59: // table body     60: str += '';     61: for (var i = 0; i      62: str += (i % 2 == 0) ? '' : '';     63: for (var index in array[i]) {     64: str += '' + array[i][index] + '';     65: }     66: str += '';     67: }     68: str += ''     69: str += '';     70: return str;     71: }     72:      73:      74:     You can check the downloadable demo code for full html page examples on how to post messages, read messages or read notifications, which is the most commonly used scenarios for the REST APIs. Any other feed or needed information uses the same pattern and you can locate the different REST feed end points from yammer developer documentation at http://developer.yammer.com/restapi.   From the downloadable demo code package you can also find simple SharePoint hosted app versions of the html pages. These are just demonstrating the same JavaScript code as the html pages, but you can use them directly in the SharePoint. Notice that they just demonstrate the API calls and I’ve not done any work on properly outputting any response messages, that’s something you can add there, if you need that. Here’s a screen shot of a SharePoint developer site with the REST API app parts added to it.    REST API usage in SharePoint  How would I use this REST API in SharePoint? – There’s multiple different options. You could build App, which is performing the required actions using either JavaScript or .NET code in server side, but in most of the case, you’d be looking to simply place the required JavaScript to the master page or to the page layout used in your portal. This would be providing the maximum flexibility to combine SharePoint CSOM and Yammer capabilities in the context of the particular user, which is anyway the normal case with these capabilities.   Summary and some additional references  Like you can see from the provided information and the downloadable examples, building end user friendly social intranet with Yammer and SharePoint is really not that hard and it can bring lot of value for your deployments. Yammer is yet again one of those excellent services or tools to select for your overall architecture design. Like mentioned in the start of this post, you don’t have to be an oracle to foresee that Office365 and Yammer integration will get closer out of the box in the future as well, but already today you could build real enterprise scale social intranets to the cloud or to the on-premises using the available APIs.  Here’s some additional information on the technical details.    Code samples shown in this blog post     One Visual Studio 2013 solution containing three html pages with simple Yammer integration samples and same three scenarios provided as app parts in SharePoint hosted app. Solution also contains on embed app part example for showing personal messages from Yammer. Notice that to be able to use these, you’ll need to register the Yammer App ID to your network and to update the examples accordingly.   Even though these are provided as SP apps, most likely the best option is to use the JavaScript directly in the page layout/master page for providing the best end user experience. These examples are pretty simple to demonstrate the scenario, but don’t them fool you, those concept pictures shown in this blog post are 100% doable and do not require rocket science degree from JavaScript.

"In the rapidly expanding realm of computing technologies, it's reasonable to assume that most developers have only a limited spread of knowledge. I regularly hear it said that keeping up with the welter of new frameworks, platforms, systems, and capabilities is almost impossible. Except that it's only occasionally you actually get abruptly confronted with this uncomfortable truth....(read more)",Java
"&nbsp;             Sample Download : http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/How-to-Search-Items-by-3de58d8d Now we can easily search email messages by retention policy in Outlook. But this feature is not available in Outlook Web App(OWA). In this application, we demonstrate how to search email messages with retention policy enabled in Office 365 Exchange Online by using Exchange Web Service Managed API. We use the following extend properties to search and get the information: 1. PidTagRetentionPeriod (Property ID:0x301A);2. PidTagRetentionDate (Property ID:0x301C). You can find more code samples that demonstrate the most typical programming scenarios by using Microsoft All-In-One Code Framework Sample Browser or Sample Browser Visual Studio extension. They give you the flexibility to search samples, download samples on demand, manage the downloaded samples in a centralized place, and automatically be notified about sample updates. If it is the first time that you hear about Microsoft All-In-One Code Framework, please watch the introduction video on Microsoft Showcase, or read the introduction on our homepage http://1code.codeplex.com/.",Java
"皆様、こんにちは！今回は、データアクセス・認証と疎結合コンポーネント間通信のデモを取り上げます。次のユーザー入力の検証でこのデモ解説は終了です。今回も冒頭はスライドシェアのリンクです。 Windows 8.1 におけるストア ビジネスアプリの設計と開発&gt Windows 8.1 におけるストア ビジネスアプリの設計と開発 from Shotaro Suzuki   Prism for Windowr Runtime では、スライドにある通り、こちらのアプリケーション データの管理の箇所が関連します。 http://msdn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/library/windows/apps/xx130650.aspx さて、この部分のスライドでは、ローカルデータ・リモートデータの扱い、認証の話、それから、ASP.NET Web API の利用、についてまとめてあります。   ローカルデータ・リモートデータの扱い まずは、ストアアプリに関しては、データアクセスの選択肢の話があります。こちらは、全体像を見て戴ければと思います。   ---&#160; アプリケーション データの管理 Windows ストア アプリが接続できる Web サービスを実装するにはさまざまな方法があります。  Window Azure のモバイル サービスを使うと、Windows ストア アプリにクラウドベースのサービスを追加できます。詳しくは、Window Azure のモバイル サービスのデベロッパー センターをご覧ください。  Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) を使うと、SOAP ベースの Web サービスを開発できます。これらのサービスでは、サービスをトランスポート プロトコルから分離することに重点が置かれています。そのため、さまざまなエンドポイントとさまざまなプロトコルを使って同じサービスを公開できます (TCP、ユーザー データグラム プロトコル (UDP)、HTTP、Secure HTTP (HTTPS)、メッセージ キューなど)。ただし、この柔軟性を実現するために多くの構成と属性が使われるため、インフラストラクチャを簡単に検証できなくなる場合があります。さらに、サービスの入力モデルや出力モデルが変更されるたびに新しいクライアント プロキシを生成する必要があります。  ASP.NET Web API を使うと、HTTP で直接公開される Web サービスを開発できるため、アプリケーション レイヤー プロトコルとしての HTTP をフル活用できます。開発した Web サービスは、アプリ、ブラウザー、バックエンド サービスなど、幅広いクライアントと通信できます。ASP.NET Web API は、REST を使って作成されたアプリをサポートするように設計されていますが、RESTful アーキテクチャの使用は強制されません。そのため、サービスの入力モデルや出力モデルが変更された場合、クライアントでは、Web サービスに送信するクエリ文字列や Web サービスから受け取るデータの解析方法を変更するだけで済みます。  WCF と ASP.NET Web API の最大の違いは、WCF が SOAP に基づいているのに対して ASP.NET Web API は HTTP に基づいていることです。HTTP には次の利点があります。  操作を定義する動詞をサポートしています。たとえば、情報を照会するには GET を使い、情報を作成するには POST を使います。  意味のある説明的なメッセージ ヘッダーが含まれています。たとえば、ヘッダーからメッセージ本文のコンテンツの種類がわかります。  XML コンテンツに限定される SOAP とは違ってあらゆる種類のコンテンツを使用できる本文が含まれています。HTTP メッセージの本文では、HTML、XML、JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)、バイナリ ファイルなど、あらゆる種類のコンテンツを使用できます。  リソースと操作の両方を Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) を使って識別します。  アプリで WCF と ASP.NET Web API のどちらを使えばよいかは、次の質問に答えることによって判断できます。  作成するサービスで、一方向メッセージング、メッセージ キュー、双方向通信などの特殊なシナリオをサポートしますか。その場合は、WCF を使う必要があります。  作成するサービスで、高速なトランスポート チャネル (TCP、名前付きパイプ、UDP など) を使用できる場合は使いますか。その場合は、WCF を使う必要があります。  作成するサービスで、高速なトランスポート チャネルを使用できる場合はそれを使い、他のトランスポート チャネルを使用できない場合は HTTP を使いますか。その場合は、WCF を使う必要があります。  オブジェクトを単純にシリアル化して送信し、送信先で同じ厳密に型指定されたオブジェクトとして逆シリアル化しますか。その場合は、WCF を使う必要があります。  HTTP 以外のプロトコルを使う必要がありますか。その場合は、WCF を使う必要があります。  作成するサービスは、GET などの単純な操作指向の動詞によってアクティブ化され、HTML、XML、JSON 文字列、バイナリ データなどのコンテンツを送信することによって応答する、リソース指向のサービスですか。その場合は、ASP.NET Web API を使う必要があります。  帯域幅の制限がありますか。その場合は、ASP.NET Web API と JSON を使う必要があります。そうすると、送信されるペイロードが SOAP に比べて小さくなります。  SOAP スタックを持たないクライアントをサポートする必要がありますか。その場合は、ASP.NET Web API を使う必要があります。  ---  ASP.NET Web API の利用について 次に、この部分に関しては、論理アーキテクチャー図を見てください。  セッションでもお見せした通り、Adventure Works リファレンスサンプルソリューションを見て貰えればと思います。ソリューションエクスプローラーで、AdventureWorks.WebServices となっているプロジェクトを見てください。上記の図の、Cloud or Services のレイヤーに相当します。これ自体が、ASP.NET Web API のプロジェクトになっていま���。このプロジェクト内の、Services と Repositories 部分に実装されています。たとえば、Products（ここでは、自転車関連の商品）を例にとるとこんな感じですね。 Repositories フォルダ：ProductRepository.cs    1: // THIS CODE AND INFORMATION IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF     2: // ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO     3: // THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A     4: // PARTICULAR PURPOSE.     5: //     6: // Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

"When we use cell level encryption, we usually create a symmetric key, do the encryption and close it. And again when we want to query the data, we open the key, perform the decryption and read the data. Here, in this article, I'll talk about the side effects if you forget/ignore to close the keys you opened for decrypting the data. Let’s do a simple exercise to understand how we do the encryption and decryption and we’ll try to replicate the scenario I was talking about. First we’ll create 2 logins to play with and a database followed by table with few columns to perform cell level encryption. Here we have two managers and they’re storing their employee details like id, name, SSN and rating details in a table called EmpTable. We’re encrypting the SSN and the rating details as they’re confidential and should only be visible to their respective managers. Create login Man1 with password = 'Man1pwd' Go Create login Man2 with password = 'Man2pwd' Go &#160; create database CompanyDB go &#160; use CompanyDB go create user Man1; go create user Man2 go &#160; create table EmpTable (Id int, name nvarchar(30), Manname varchar(20), SSN varbinary(60), Rating varbinary(4000)) go &#160; --grant access to the table to both doctors grant select,insert on EmpTable to Man1 grant select,insert on EmpTable to Man2 &#160;

create symmetric key Man2Key authorization Man2 with algorithm = TRIPLE_DES ENCRYPTION BY certificate Man2Cert go &#160; Now we’ll do the encryption &#160; &#160; execute as login = 'Man1' &#160; open symmetric key Man1Key decryption by certificate Man1cert &#160; &#160; insert into EmpTable values (1, 'Chris','Man1', encryptByKey(Key_GUID('Man1Key'),'111-11-1111'), encryptByKey(Key_GUID('Man1Key'),'Exceeded Expectations')) insert into EmpTable values (2, 'Charles','Man1', encryptByKey(Key_GUID('Man1Key'),'222-22-2222'), encryptByKey(Key_GUID('Man1Key'),'Met Expectations’)) insert into EmpTable values (3, 'James','Man1', encryptByKey(Key_GUID('Man1Key'),'333-33-3333'), encryptByKey(Key_GUID('Man1Key'),'Partially Met Expectations')) &#160;

This is because, the keys that is required to decrypt this data is still open. And even though the login Doc 2 does not have the permission can still see the data that was encrypted using the Man1’s keys. This is only possible on the same session with impersonation.  &#160;The query processor don’t validate if the owner of the key or the user who encrypted the data is doing the decryption or not. i.e. if a key, protecting the data/used to encrypt the data is open, whoever issues a select query against the encrypted columns will get the data in decrypted form, in the same session. The point here is that when the keys are opened in a session and if there is a login or user where the caller has IMPERSONATE permissions on the another login/User, and if he changes the execution context to the new login, which really does not have permissions on the keys used for encryption, will still be able to see the data if the keys were not closed before changing the context. As in the above example.  The better way of changing the execution context in such cases where you do not want the data to be read would be to close the keys and then change the execution context as shown below: execute as login = 'Man1' open symmetric key Man1Key decryption by certificate Man1Cert select Id, name, Manname, convert(varchar,decryptbykey(SSN)) as SSN, convert (varchar,decryptbykey(Problem)) as Rating from EmpTable &#160; Id&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; name&#160;&#160; Manname&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; SSN&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Rating 1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Chris&#160; Man1&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 111-11-1111&#160;&#160; Exceeded Expectations 2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CharlesMan1&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 222-22-2222&#160;&#160; Met Expectations 3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; James&#160; Man1&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 333-33-3333&#160;&#160; Partially Met Expectations 4&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Dave&#160;&#160; Man2&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL 5&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Dan&#160;&#160;&#160; Man2&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL 6&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Steve&#160; Man2&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL &#160; close all symmetric keys &#160; Revert &#160; execute as login = 'Man2' select Id, name, Manname, convert(varchar,decryptbykey(SSN)) as SSN, convert (varchar,decryptbykey(Problem)) as Rating from EmpTable &#160; Id&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; name&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Manname&#160;&#160;&#160; SSN&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Rating ----------- ----------- ---------- -------- ----------- 1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Chris&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Man1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL 2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Charles&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Man1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL 3&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; James&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Man1&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL 991&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Dave&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Man2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL 1001&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Dan&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Man2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL 1011&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Steve&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Man2&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; NULL (6 row(s) affected) &#160; So it’s always suggestible to close your keys after reading the data, especially in the environments where same session’s state is shared by multiple client connections/users. p.s. This feature is also useful in cases where a user want to share some/all of his data with the other users. For e.g. Manager1 want to share some/all of his employee’s details with other Managers. In this case instead of sharing his keys to those guys, he can just open his key and can allow others to read data from his session. He can close his key after the other guys completed querying the data. &#160; As always, please feel free to get in touch with me with your comments or feedback. Thanks, Chandra",Java

"Ol&aacute;, pessoas! Realizei hoje a renova&ccedil;&atilde;o da minha filia&ccedil;&atilde;o ao PMI pela sexta vez consecutiva! Ou seja, s&atilde;o 7 anos envolvido com a maior institui&ccedil;&atilde;o mundial relacionada ao Gerenciamento de Projetos. Durante a faculdade e o MBA, ouvi v&aacute;rios professores falarem sobre o PMI e de que seria bom para a minha carreira. E n&atilde;o &eacute; que eles tinham raz&atilde;o! Me filiei ao PMI em Mar&ccedil;o de 2008 e durante alguns meses fiquei apenas como espectador! No final de 2008, tive o meu primeiro envolvimento mais pr&oacute;ximo com o PMI, chapter de Goi&acirc;nia (PMI-GO). A empresa que eu estava iniciando na &eacute;poca&nbsp;foi patrocinadora do Semin&aacute;rio Regional do PMI-GO. No in&iacute;cio de 2009 veio o convite para assumir a diretoria de Administra&ccedil;&atilde;o e Finan&ccedil;as do PMI-GO at&eacute; o final do mandato vigente. No final de 2009, veio a elei&ccedil;&atilde;o e fui confirmado como vice-presidente, cargo que exerci por 2 mandatos consecutivos (2010-2011 e 2012-2013). Diretoria do PMI-GO no Semin&aacute;rio de 2012 Este envolvimento com o PMI-GO me abriu diversas portas! Dentre elas, algumas de car&aacute;ter profissional:&nbsp;oportunidade de come&ccedil;ar a carreira acad&ecirc;mica (p&oacute;s-gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o e gradua&ccedil;&atilde;o), coordenar cursos de MBA, consultorias e at&eacute; mesmo empregos; e outras de networking e reconhecimento. O PMI possibilitou que eu me sentasse lado a lado com os principais &iacute;cones e personagens do Gerenciamento de Projetos do Brasil e do mundo em almo&ccedil;os, jantares e eventos, como podem ver foto abaixo. Lideres do PMI no Congresso Brasileiro de 2009&nbsp; O slogan "Coisas boas acontecem quando voc&ecirc; est&aacute; envolvido com o PMI" realmente &eacute; verdadeiro! Apesar de todos os momentos de trabalho (e foram muitos), de reuni&otilde;es no domingo pela manh&atilde; at&eacute; eventos que&nbsp;me privava do conv&iacute;vio familiar&nbsp;por alguns dias, tudo valeu (e vale) a pena! No &uacute;ltimo ano me filiei tamb&eacute;m ao chapter S&atilde;o Paulo (PMI-SP). Ainda n&atilde;o tive como ajudar de forma mais direta, mas espero poder faz&ecirc;-lo em breve. Tive a honra em ser nomeado conselheiro do PMI-GO no in&iacute;cio deste ano e&nbsp;agrade&ccedil;o por poder continuar contribuindo&nbsp;com a&nbsp;comunidade de Gerenciamento de Projetos de Goi&aacute;s.  Para quem n&atilde;o conhece, o PMI &eacute; uma institui&ccedil;&atilde;o que nasceu em 1969, nos Estados Unidos, com o objetivo de disseminar as boas pr&aacute;ticas em Gerenciamento de Projetos. A maior parte das pessoas envolvidas com o PMI trabalham de forma volunt&aacute;ria, ou seja, n&atilde;o s&atilde;o remuneradas diretamente pelo trabalho realizado. Entretanto, a exposi&ccedil;&atilde;o ao mercado, o reconhecimento e o networking s&atilde;o contrapartidas que se recebe e que s&atilde;o imensur&aacute;veis. As principais contribui&ccedil;&otilde;es do PMI para a comunidade s&atilde;o: a publica&ccedil;&atilde;o dos padr&otilde;es (standards) que re&uacute;nem as boas pr&aacute;ticas de mercado, tal como o PMBOK Guide; e as provas de certifica&ccedil;&atilde;o, tais como PMP e CAPM. O PMI est&aacute; presente em mais de 160 pa&iacute;ses e no Brasil &eacute; a organiza&ccedil;&atilde;o mais reconhecida e respeitada sobre Gerenciamento de Projetos. O PMI est&aacute; dividido em regionais (chapters) e no Brasil existem 15.

"Web applications, Windows services, and other applications frequently need to write to an event log on the server. In many cases, it is beneficial to create new event log sources or even new event logs. This allows easier finding of events and in the case of new event logs, custom management of event log size or other maintenance needs. In order to create an event log or source, administrative privileges is required. Consequently, you should never write your application so that it creates an event log or source at run time, because that would require your application to run under administrative privileges. This violates a critical rule, that applications should run under an account having least privileges necessary, so that if the service account is compromised, an attacker would not gain administrative privileges over your server. By having event log sources already created, the application developer can simply write to the event log, assuming the event log source already exists. The developer can choose to write the code in a try / catch block with error handling to write to a standard event log, database log, etc. according to their design, but that is out of scope for this post, I will focus only on the PowerShell script and execution of it. This blog posting gives code example on how to author a PowerShell script that will create event logs and event log sources. If the source already exists, it will give a message indicating such. This simple script is designed to be executed at time of install of the application, not during run time of the application, thus eliminating the potential security vulnerability of elevation of privileges. This PowerShell script works without user input, where the application configuration is entered directly into the script as an array of comma delimited pairs of event logs,event log sources. Simply modify the values in the variable $eventSources and run it. In the example given, the $eventSources is configured to create 2 sources on the Application log, then create 2 new event logs with corresponding sources. Note: at time of writing, I am not including how to delete event log sources, or options on how to run the script based on local policy. I will update this post in a few days as that could be beneficial to test and support personnel.     # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- # CreateEventLogSources.ps1 # AUTHOR: Ken O.

"We are pushing ahead hard with new features for the Mobile Services .NET backend – here are some of the updates that are now available in the latest NuGet packages as well as in the Quick Starts:   Updated to Web API 2.1, Azure Storage 3.3, and JSON.NET 6.0   Support for sending Windows Phone push notifications (a.k.a Microsoft Push Notifications Service or MPNS). This is in addition to the platforms already supported including Apple Push Notification Service (APNS),&#160; Google Cloud Messaging for Chrome (GCM), and Windows Push Notification Service (WNS).   Support for HTTP basic authentication from a browser when accessing protected parts of your service in the cloud. This allows you to use a browser to access for example the help page.  To authenticate against resources that require Application Key access, you can use the Application Key as password To authenticate against resources that require Master Key access (i.e. admin) you can use the Master Key as password  Note that in both cases the user name does not matter.  You can get (as well as regenerate) the Application Key and the Master Key from the Azure portal, select your mobile service, and hit Manage Keys at the bottom of the screen.   Updates to the Quick Starts to make it easier to do Entity Framework migrations (the schema is now picked up automatically which makes the Entity Framework migration tooling takes it into account when creating the migration).   Getting the Latest NuGet Packages To update your NuGet packages in an existing project, open the solution in Visual Studio, right click on the solution in the Solution Explorer and select Manage NuGet Packages for Solution. Under Updates, look for the packages with id WindowsAzure.MobileServices.Backend.Entity (it includes references to the other packages used in the Quick Start) and select update.

"This post will show how to merge using Git.&#160; This is the third post in a series.  Git for Team Foundation Developers Git for Team Foundation Developers – Branches Git for Team Foundation Developers – Merging (this post)  The series focuses on introducing Git for developers who are familiar with Team Foundation Version Control. Background One of the absolute coolest parts of Git is the flexibility it has with merging.&#160; The types of scenarios it enables are exactly the scenarios that you face daily.&#160; You make lots of check-ins, some of them you need to make (“Going on vacation… sorry if this breaks the build”), others you are happy to make (“Version 3 release… time for vacation”).&#160; At the same time, other members of your team are also making check-ins.&#160; Git makes it easy to merge your frequent check-ins (“going to lunch” type check-ins) with the release branch for your team, and it makes it easy for you to merge your changes with the rest of the team. Creating Branches My previous post talked about branches in Git.&#160; This is the thing I now most about Git, and also one of the things that completely tripped me up originally because I didn’t understand all the names that Git used.&#160; When I create a team project in Visual Studio online, I clone the repository to a local repository.&#160; I get the default branch, master.&#160; I then create another branch, v2, and publish it to Visual Studio Online.&#160; Here is what my branches look like right now:  What you don’t see in this picture is that there are actually 4 branches: 2 local, 2 remote.&#160; VSOnline is the “origin” of the code, and each user has their own local repository.  The reason I bring this up in a discussion of merging is because you will see the term “ORIGIN” occasionally.&#160; You can choose to create a branch from an existing branch in your local repository or the remote repository. Our team decided to use the v2 branch for builds.&#160; I first switch to the v2 branch (which switches in my local repository), and then I sync changes by clicking the Sync button, pulling changes from Visual Studio Online and pushing any outgoing commits.  Now that I know the local v2 and origin v2 repositories are synchronized, I am going to create a branch, kirke_v2, to do my work in.&#160; The rest of my team may have branches specific to them, such as Simon_v2, Donovan_v2, and Paul_v2.&#160; They are free to make whatever changes they want to their local branch, even publish that branch to the server, knowing that those changes are not part of the branch that our team is using for builds, the v2 branch.  Think about how powerful this is.&#160; Rather than do all of your work against the central repository and possibly break the build, you can fetch the latest source from a particular branch on the server and work locally.&#160; When you are ready to push your changes to the server, you do that explicitly.&#160; I like that model. Now that I’ve created the kirke_v2 branch, notice that it is local only and is not on the server.&#160; We can tell that because it is an “unpublished branch”.  Finally, I decide to publish that branch to Visual Studio Online.&#160;   There are now 6 total branches (3 local and 3 remote), and any changes that I make continue to work only against the local repository until I decide to push the changes to the remote repository. Change Happens Let’s cause a few changes.&#160; Here is my project as I start:  I am going to add a few classes.&#160; Here’s my base class.  I then implement a ConsoleOutputWriter and a DebugOutputWriter.  Each time I write some code, I commit.&#160; You probably wouldn’t do this in your daily work, but I am doing it here to highlight how commits are tracked.  Studying History Each time I added code, I made sure to commit.&#160; You can see the history for the kirke_v2 branch in Visual Studio.&#160; Go to Changes / Actions / View History.  The history for the branch is now shown.&#160; Notice those two markers on the right.&#160; Those show the pointers to the last commit in master that the branch kirke_v2 knows about, and the last commit in kirke_v2.  Let me explain that last part a little.&#160; The pointer to master points to ffffb5c7, “Modified to use an interface”.&#160; We’ll see in a second that the “v2” branch actually has new commits in it made by a new intern in our group.&#160; When we branched from “v2” to create “kirke_v2”, Git copied all of the commits to the kirke_v2 branch.&#160; Think of it as a complete copy of all the commits from the source branch, because that’s what it is. Let’s go over to Git Bash.&#160; We will run a program called “gitk”.  gitk opens, and we can see all of our checkins represented as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).&#160; I use this fancy word not to show off my incredibly vocabulary and sound as geeky as possible, but to point out that this term is used frequently in the Git documentation.&#160; A directed acyclic graph is where you go from node to node and can never revisit a node.&#160; For instance:   The DAG shows all of the commits, with the most recent at top Each commit is by a user at a specific time Each commit has history that can be used to show the different between the current commit and the previous commit.  GitK is a fairly useful tool.&#160;  Notice the changes that it is showing in section 3, highlighting new code in the Main method (using a green font).&#160;&#160;&#160;  Managing Conflict While I’ve been busy working on my fancy new class structure for writing output, a new intern in our group took the initiative to go make changes in Program.cs and commit them to the v2 branch, the same branch I’m about to merge my awesome new code into. &#160; Houston, we have a conflict.&#160; Of course, I won’t know this yet because that change commit is not in my kirke_v2 branch, but I’ll discover it when I attempt to merge.&#160; That edit is smack-dab in the middle of the edits we made, and Git will let us know there’s a conflict that has to be resolved.&#160; To see this in action, let’s try to merge our changes from the kirke_v2 branch to the v2 branch. I want to first make sure that I have the latest source for v2.&#160; I first switch to the v2 branch.  Next, I use the Sync button to pull commits from the remote repository.&#160;   Now the v2 branch is synchronized with my local repository. Go to Team Explorer / Branches to view the branches, and then choose Merge.&#160; The dialog will change to ask you to pick a source and destination.  Click the Merge button, and we start yelling at the intern.  Visual Studio is doing something incredibly nice for us here.&#160; If you’re not familiar with Unix tools like vim, then editing this stuff using Git Bash is going to be very difficult.&#160; Thankfully, the Visual Studio team provided a UI for this.&#160; Click the “Resolve the conflicts” link.&#160; The dialog changes to:  OK, that’s not very helpful.&#160; Click the program.cs file in the Conflicts section.  That’s a little better.&#160; Click that big “Merge” button.  Ah, there we go!&#160; A visual diff tool that allows us to pick the changes from the conflicting commits.&#160; Next to each conflict (highlighted in red in the tool) is a checkbox so that you can visually select which change stays.&#160; The bottom pane shows the results.  Take that, intern. Here’s the confusing part… what next?&#160; The file has an asterisk next to its name, and its not a preview file it’s a file actually opened for editing.&#160; Do I save it, or do I click that big “Merge” button on the right of the screen?&#160;  Tucked away, somewhat hidden, is a button that says “Accept Merge”.  Click that, and now the Team Explorer pane changes to include a button that says “Commit Merge”.  Click the Commit Merge button.&#160; Remember how we started this out trying to commit our changes?&#160; Visual Studio says, “you’ve resolved all the problems, but we still haven’t done a commit.”&#160;   Finally, we want to push our changes to Visual Studio Online so that the rest of the team can use them.&#160; We can then go to Changes and see the unsynced commits section that shows all of the commits in our local repository.&#160; We go to the outgoing commits section and click Push to push them into the remote repository.  The results show that we were successful pushing to “origin/v2”.  Now hopefully you see why I started this post with the explanation of “origin”.&#160;  Let’s go to Visual Studio Online again.&#160; A nice shortcut to get there is to use the link in Visual Studio.  We are taken to the portal, and we switch to the Code section.&#160; Click the History tab, and we can see all of our commits, including the merge, are in the commit history.  Visualizing the Branches Like I said in my previous posts, it helps to understand what Git is doing under the covers because the Visual Studio tools are nice enough to hide some of the gory details from us.&#160; Let’s go back to the Git command line tools.&#160; We used Git Bash to open a visual tool called gitk.&#160; We should already have gitk open from our previous demo, go to the gitk File menu and choose “Start git gui”.  Once Git Gui starts, we can choose “Visualize All Branch History”.  That command will then launch gitk again, and now we can see the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for our commits.&#160; The picture below is straight out of the GitK tool, I didn’t draw this myself, so this can be a hugely valuable tool for understanding what’s going on in your commit history.&#160;  Here is what it looked like after I pushed to the remote repository.  A little explanation of what you’re looking at is in order.&#160; You’re not looking at a time line, but rather a visualization of the commits.&#160; In a previous post I commented that changes have parents, and that is what this graph is showing. The initial vertex in the graph is our initial check-in at the bottom where I was working in the master branch.&#160; I made a few changes, and then at the 5th commit I pushed the changes to “remotes/origin/master”.&#160; What’s interesting here is that the same line also shows a push to “remotes/origin/kirke_v2”.&#160; This graph doesn’t show when the branches were created, it just shows when something happened on them.&#160; When I created the kirke_v2 branch and published it at the beginning of this post, the changes it had were the same changes as in v2 and in master.&#160; At some point, the intern added a commit to the v2 branch (the nodes do not reflect time relative to each branch, only precedence on the current branch).&#160; We finally see our kirke_v2 branch is merged with the main v2 branch and pushed to “remotes/origin/v2”. Note: I’m impressed that I made it this far without really explaining the DAG and the various types in it.&#160; Most texts you read on Git dive into tag, branch, commit, tree, and blob by now.&#160; My goal is to make you familiar and productive, not to mire you in theory.&#160;  For More Information Use Git branches to switch contexts, suspend work, and isolate risk Resolve Git conflicts",Java

"Looking through customer comments on my topic, Getting Started with the HTML5 Audio Element. I found a question that was similar to another topic comment; how to turn off a video or how to cut the audio volume when you go to another page from a website.  I hadn't tried that before, so I experimented with the focus and blur events. It turned out to be relatively easy, as long as I watched for events that called other events.  Using the focus and blur events The focus and blur events aren't directly related to the media (audio or video) object, they're actually on the window object. The focus event fires when a webpage gets focus (that is, ready to interact with you). The blur event fires when you lose focus. Using them is pretty straight forward:  // when you leave a page window.addEventListener(&quot;blur&quot;, function(){ &#160;&#160; //do something here }, false);  // when you return (or open) to a page window.addEventListener(&quot;focus&quot;,function(){ &#160; // do something else here } Now you need to add code to the &quot;do something part.  To test the examples here open two tabs, one with the sample, and another page (anything will do).  Pause video on leaving, pickup when you come back For simplicity, I'm using an audio element, but you can do this as well with video. This example plays a clip of audio and pauses when you go to another tab or even switch to another app. The &quot;wasPlaying&quot; flag tracks whether the audio was playing or not when you lost focus.  The one issue I had is how to keep the &quot;wasPlaying&quot; flag current. The best way is to use the &quot;play&quot; or &quot;pause&quot; events to set the flag, like in previous media posts where we set the Play button text. In the &quot;play&quot; event handler, we set &quot;wasPlaying&quot; to true, and to false in the &quot;pause&quot; event handler. However, in addition to setting the &quot;wasPlaying&quot; flag, we need an additional flag to tell us that we are leaving when we called pause.&#160;  The reason is that when you call pause() it fires the pause event, which is where we set&#160; the &quot;wasPlaying&quot; flag to false. If we didn't track that we were leaving, we'd pause the audio when we lost focus like nothing happened. When we return though, the &quot;wasPlaying&quot; flag would have been set to false in the &quot;pause&quot; event, and we wouldn't call play() to get started again.  Confused?

This example is actually simpler than pausing the music, because we don't need to worry about setting a special flag when we fire pause/play events.  To adjust the volume, we use the volume property on the media object. Volume is set between 0 and 1. When we lose focus, we're setting the volume to 1/3 what it was. You can set it to anything (even full volume to get users back to your page if you want). We stash the current volume in a variable when we lose focus so we can reset it when we come back.

"The Azure Mobile Services .NET backend has a lot of flexibility in how you can configure and use it. It allows you to plug in additional components, change existing components, and configure how it works. Here we describe the main configuration and extensibility points as well as the common path. Typically you should be able to get by with very little -- the goal is to be there when you want it and get out of the way when you need it. Bootstrapping The first step is to define which method is to be called on start-up – we call this the bootstrapper. By default the backend looks for a static class called WebApiConfig (the CLR namespace doesn’t matter) with a public static, parameter-less method called Register. This is by far the common way of bootstrapping and is what the tooling will suggest. If the .NET backend finds a Register class then it is simply called and initialization happens from there. A basic example of the static class looks like this:    1: public static void Register()     2: {     3: ServiceConfig.Initialize(new ConfigBuilder());     4: }    This will give you the default configuration all-around. Initialize returns the current HttpConfiguration so if you want to add or modify that then you can easily do it right then and there, for example:       1: public static class WebApiConfig     2: {     3: public static void Register()     4: {     5: HttpConfiguration config = ServiceConfig.Initialize(new ConfigBuilder());     6: config.IncludeErrorDetailPolicy = IncludeErrorDetailPolicy.Always;     7: }     8: }    However, if you would like to easily swap between different configurations, then you can use the BootstrapperAttribute to identify a class implementing the IBootstrapper interface, for example by declaring it as follows:       1: [assembly: Bootstrapper(typeof(Local.MyBootstrapper))]    The IBootstrapper interface has a single method called Initialize which will get called, for example:       1: public class MyBootstrapper : IBootstrapper     2: {     3: public void Initialize()     4: {     5: HttpConfiguration config = ServiceConfig.Initialize(new ConfigBuilder());     6: config.IncludeErrorDetailPolicy = IncludeErrorDetailPolicy.Always;     7: }     8: }     Now, instead of the static Register class, the MyBootstrapper class will get called upon startup.  Service Configuration  The next step is for the bootstrapper to call the service configuration. This happens by calling the ServiceConfig.Initialize class like this:       1: HttpConfiguration config = ServiceConfig.Initialize(new ConfigBuilder(options));    This class is responsible for getting config from the host, extensions, as well as from your code. As mentioned above, it returns the resulting HttpConfiguration which can then be further modified by your code.  Config Builder  The ServiceConfig.Initialize method takes an IConfigBuilder implementation which is responsible for initializing ASP.NET Web API, the OWIN application pipeline, and the Autofac Dependency Injection engine. The .NET backend comes with a default ConfigBuilder implementation which should be sufficient for most cases. It sets up ASP.NET Web API routes, message handlers, filters, etc. which are used by the backend.  The default ConfigBuilder takes two optional arguments: the first is ConfigOptions which is described below, and the second is a delegate which allows you to add additional services to the Autofac Dependency Injection container, for example       1: public static class WebApiConfig     2: {     3: public static void Register()     4: {     5: ConfigOptions options = new ConfigOptions();     6: HttpConfiguration config = ServiceConfig.Initialize(new ConfigBuilder(options, (httpConfig, autofac) =&gt     7: {     8: autofac.RegisterInstance(new MyDependency()).As();     9: }));     10: config.IncludeErrorDetailPolicy = IncludeErrorDetailPolicy.Always;     11: }     12: }    Wherever you have a dependency on IDependencyInterface it can now be provided by Autofac. As described in FilipW’s blog, you can even manipulate the OWIN application pipeline as an Autofac dependency:       1: public static class WebApiConfig     2: {     3: public static void Register()     4: {     5: ConfigOptions options = new ConfigOptions();     6: HttpConfiguration config = ServiceConfig.Initialize(new ConfigBuilder(options, (httpConfig, autofac) =&gt     7: {     8: autofac.RegisterInstance(new AuthOwinAppBuilder(httpConfig)).As();     9: }));     10: }     11: }    In addition, it is possible to provide your own IConfigBuilder where you can either modify or otherwise manipulate the default configuration. Here is an example of an IConfigBuilder implementation that inherits from the default implementation and hooks into one of the virtuals:       1: public class MyConfigBuilder : ConfigBuilder     2: {     3: protected override void OnComplete(HttpConfiguration config)     4: {     5: // Additional configuration     6: base.OnComplete(config);     7: }     8: }    Config Options  The ConfigOptions class is a simple property bag which contains easy setup for a bunch of backend settings. For example, you can set the minimum trace level which will get logged or include/exclude the trace categories you want to see. You can also set the minimum authorization level required to access the Diagnostics controller and other baked-in controllers. Finally you can set the default caching policy for which HTTP caching headers should get included on HTTP responses unless they already have been set by the application.  Extension Configuration  The last extensibility hook for the .NET backend provides a mechanism for extensions to also participate in the configuration. This allows extensions to hook into the configuration code path, for example, to set up their own per-controller configuration etc. This works very similar to the bootstrapper mechanism in that there is an assembly level attribute indicating the type of the extension configuration:       1: [assembly: ExtensionConfigProvider(typeof(MyExtensionConfig))]    The MyExtensionConfig must implement the IExtensionConfigProvider interface so that the configuration can call it. For example, the MyExtensionConfig can register types with Autofac as well as manipulating the HttpConfiguration for the service:       1: public class MyExtensionConfig : IExtensionConfigProvider     2: {     3: public void Initialize(HttpConfiguration config, ContainerBuilder autofac)     4: {     5: autofac.RegisterInstance(new MyDependency()).As();     6: }     7: }    Confused Yet?  Don’t panic -- the common case is that you need very little of this – typically you would use the static bootstrapper with some ConfigOptions like this:       1: public static class WebApiConfig     2: {     3: public static void Register()     4: {     5: ConfigOptions options = new ConfigOptions();     6: options.MinimumTraceLevel = TraceLevel.Debug;     7:&#160;      8: HttpConfiguration config = ServiceConfig.Initialize(new ConfigBuilder(options));     9: config.IncludeErrorDetailPolicy = IncludeErrorDetailPolicy.Always;     10:&#160;      11: // Set up local DB etc.     12: Database.SetInitializer(new MyInitializer());     13: }     14: }    This is just to show you how go beyond and truly make the .NET backend yours   Have fun!

"&nbsp;  Think of an online task you do in your day to day life and it should have a workflow backing up. Eg. you buy movie tickets online (Its a client side workflow, you go to ticketing site -&gt chose tickets -&gt confirm -&gt pay). &nbsp;Other workflow is server-side workflow which is a background task. Eg. when you buy a product on Amazon. Steps, Chose a product -&gt pay -&gt A server side workflow should kick off which contacts actual seller, calculates estimated delivery time, add order details in your account, send confirmation email to buyer and other individual tasks.Today I want to write about Windows workflow foundation 4.0 (WWF). There are other workflow frameworks like Oracle offers, Sharepoint workflow etc.But I personally liked this workflow framework. WWF a framework used to perform work intensive sequence of tasks (known as activities). Always remember, workflows are used to "Just Do Work".Eg. Do X -&gt Check Y-&gt See P -&gt Send A and for 1 million users. Your workflow in workflow designer might look like:I have been working on WWF since couple of months and I am amazed with the power of this framework. With this you can :-1. Run independent tasks/Activities in parallel2. If you have created a share point farm your workflow can run on multiple machines in parallel.3. It can be triggered by a workflow or a timer job4. Create custom activities to implement business logic.5. Set up concurrency of workflows6. Call external methods and use those results in workflow7. Automate a sequential set of tasks.I would like to talk about performance of Windows workflow. Since it runs on the application server. Doing things wrong/inefficient can slow down the entire server and eat up the processor and clog the database.I want to talk about few things which you should keep in mind while programming with Windows workflow:1.&nbsp;Performance: Its a important aspect of every piece of code. But it becomes very important in case of workflows. Eg. you have to give discount to user on your product based on the sales, page hits and other parameters in 1 million products on your website. Calculating discount for individual product should be very efficient, it should take less than a second by your workflow. Workflows should not run more than couple of hour. &nbsp;Keep batching in mind. If you are reading an item from database , processing it and writing into database try batching stuffs. Divide 1 million item in batches, read a batch of 10000 items -&gt process them -&gt save 10000 items together. Batch size is critical can be best explained by :2.&nbsp;Logging: Log every failure, successes, high importance in proper category for telemetry and support purpose.3.&nbsp;Scalability: What if you start dealing with 100 million products after supporting 1 million products. Keep this in mind. In that case, divide your products with category, run workflow for individual category. Don't do any unnecessary operation in your workflow. which can slow down your workflow by many folds.4.&nbsp;Modularization: Try to break your methods as small as you can. So that it can be used by some other activity ,help you in unit testing and improves the maintenance of the code.5.&nbsp;Memory: Keep memory leakages in mind. for eg. C# has a built in garbage collection, but always Dispose objects which are derived from IDisposable interface. When your workflow is running keep track of memory used by the workflow process in the task manager. It should increase and become constant. If ,the memory should keeps increasing during the life of the workflow, its an alarming situation.6.&nbsp;Activity flooding:&nbsp;Decomposition of every tasks to an activity might look fascinating. But creating every activity has a cost(creating activity and deleting activity ) by the workflow. We should not create 3 activities for a million object. That means if the cost of Create + Delete of an activity is 0.01 sec then you can save 20k seconds = 5 hour by creating 1 activity to do all 3 things together.Remember workflows are made to "Do work" . If you have some base cases, which will exit the workflow in between, check that condition before the workflow is kicked off.Let me know if you have more pointers to improve programming in WWF.Disclaimer:&nbsp;Ideas/Views mentioned above are purely personal and learnt with Experience/reading. Feel free to correct me.&nbsp; ",Java
